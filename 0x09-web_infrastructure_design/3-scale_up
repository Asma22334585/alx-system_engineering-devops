             For every additional element, why you are adding it?

We have added one server and one load balancer. Adding a new server has allowed us to separate
each component in their own server and yet having one extra server with all the components to
serve as a backup if any of the components or servers fails. Each server is monitored and has a
firewall. We have also added another load balancer which will handle an increased traffic.
